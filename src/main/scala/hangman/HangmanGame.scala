/** Hangman Game: Documentation
  *
  * The Hangman server utilizes a single-threaded Reactor pattern for managing
  * concurrency, Handles multiple client interactions and network events
  * concurrently.
  *
  * There are two core handlers from ./util/ that spin the dispatcher:
  * AcceptHandle and TCPTextHandle. The singleton SocketHandler wraps an
  * AcceptHandle, and creates new PlayerHandlers every time a new client joins.
  * The game object keeps track of all created handlers, such that it can remove
  * them from the dispatcher when the game has come to a finished state.
  *
  * The PlayerHandler wraps a TCPTextHandle, and listens to input from the
  * player. There could have been a split into a RegisteringHandler and then a
  * PlayingHandler (or similar), such that the RegisteringHandler got the name
  * and quit, creating an initialized PlayingHandler (with player name already
  * set). Instead we decided to do this in one object that has internal state:
  * namely the PlayerHandler has the `nameOption` member variable, and handles
  * incoming messages differently depending on if the name is initialized (if
  * the player is registered). The PlayerHandler ignores newlines and extra
  * characters.
  *
  * When the game is finished, the server will always immediately exit cleanly,
  * as all handlers are removed one-by-one.
