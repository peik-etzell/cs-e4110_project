// # Dispatcher
// Main idea: Use thread safety of BlockingEventQueue from task A,
// combined with multiple threads created in addHandler().
//
// ## Avoiding an infinite wait
// The biggest risk here seems to be (was the biggest problem) to keep the
// dispatcher from waiting forever for a new message, when the last worker
// stopped running after the dispatcher went requesting a new event.
// The solution here was to use an empty message after decrementing the active-
// worker-counter, which wakes up the dispatcher, which then sees that no more
// workers are available, then exits.
//
// ## Atomic integer counter
// To ensure the running -> non-running switch of a thread is seen immediately
// by the dispatcher, it was extracted to an atomic integer instead of the
// dispatcher checking the status of the threads one-by-one. This should ensure
// changes are seen immediately, and they happen before sending sentinel
// messages, which implies the counter is up-to-date before the dispatcher
// checks it again.
